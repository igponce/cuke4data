# Example Gherkin4Data Transformation

Transformation: "Normalize user records"

Scope: For every user record
   Given a record
   Since this is a processing language
   And all suff we make here is
   Not just for checking data
   But also for data manipulation
   Except when it does not make sense
   For each rule we define we'll run a match
   For every rule defined in data_rules.py
   Every record will be be matched against data_rules
   When we have a match
   And there is more than rule that applies to a data portion, we'll
   Not just blindly overwrite the data more than once
   But we will sort the rules by priority
   ____until___ all data is filtered and have a golden record.
